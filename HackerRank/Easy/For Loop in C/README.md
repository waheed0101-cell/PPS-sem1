# For Loop in C

**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Topics:** N/A  
**HackerRank URL:** [For Loop in C](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/for-loop-in-c/problem)

## Problem Description

**Objective**

In this challenge, you will learn the usage of the *for* loop, which is a programming language statement which allows code to be executed until a terminal condition is met.  They can even repeat forever if the terminal condition is never met.

The syntax for the `for` loop is:

```
for ( <expression_1> ; <expression_2> ; <expression_3> )
    <statement>

```

* *expression_1* is used for intializing variables which are generally used for controlling the terminating flag for the loop.

* *expression_2* is used to check for the terminating condition. If this evaluates to false, then the loop is terminated.

* *expression_3* is generally used to update the flags/variables.

The following loop initializes  to 0, tests that  is less than 10, and increments  at every iteration.  It will execute 10 times.

```
for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    ...
}

```

**Task**

For each integer  in the interval  (given as input) :

* If , then print the English representation of it in lowercase. That is "one" for , "two" for , and so on.

* Else if  and it is an even number, then print "even".

* Else if  and it is an odd number, then print "odd".

**Input Format**

The first line contains an integer, . **
The seond line contains an integer, .

Constraints**

**Output Format**

Print the appropriate English representation,`even`, or `odd`, based on the conditions described in the 'task' section.

**Note:**

**Sample Input**

```
8
11

```

**Sample Output**

```
eight
nine
even
odd

```
